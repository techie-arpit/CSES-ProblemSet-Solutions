You are given all numbers between 1,2,â€¦,n
 except one. Your task is to find the missing number.

In this question, we are given n-1 numbers from 1 to n and we need to find which number is missing in between.
So, we can first input all the numbers and sort them and then run a loop and as soon as we find some number is missing
we can break the loop and give that i as output.
