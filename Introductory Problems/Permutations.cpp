/*
A permutation of integers 1,2,â€¦,n
 is called beautiful if there are no adjacent elements whose difference is 1
.

Given n
, construct a beautiful permutation if such a permutation exists.

In this question, we need to give the permutation of n numbers such that difference between any two adjacent numbers is not 1.

First seeing the base cases

n=1 
Simply 1

n=2
Two possible cases 1,2 and 2,1 both have adjacent difference 1

Similarly for n=3 we have 6 combinations and each of them have atleast one adjacent difference 1.

n=4
We can have 3,1,4,2

Now, for each odd n we can just put in before 3 so that newly generted adjacent difference will be 2 and for each odd n we can put it 
behind 2 so that each newly generated adjacent difference is 2.
Hence for n>=4 it will such a permutation will always exist.
